### Data Source 
- I chose the winequality-white data set found at the following hyperlink: [WINE](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)

### Dataset File 
- [White Wine](winequality-white.csv)


### Method to pull in the data to the programs in the project 
- The only method I used to pull in the dataset after adding the winequality-white.csv was the pandas .read_csv method that we learned in class.
- Other than this when downloading the file, I just had to use built-in methods to windows O.S. to unzip the file and drag and drop the csv file into the same folder that contained my repo.

#### Reason for choosing this Dataset
I had in my original project proposal looked around and found two data sets from the government but wasn't really satisfied with the data or subject that was in them.
- [First data set I looked at](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2023/demo/income-poverty/p60-279.html)
- [Second data set I looked at](https://www.census.gov/topics/families/marriage-and-divorce/data/tables.2022.List_1621025217.html#list-tab-List_1621025217)

I ended up searching around for a few hours during the process of milestone 1 over various datasets from the UC Irvine Machine learning repo that was at the top of program 3, and narrowed it down to three:
- [WINE](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)
- [DROPOUT DATA](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success)
- [AIR QUALITY](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality)

and ended up choosing **WINE** because the dataset wasn't too technical, and there wasn't any binary classifiers that were listed off on the webpage that I had to flip back and forth to look at. I specifically used the White wine csv.
